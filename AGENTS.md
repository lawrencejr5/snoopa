# Snoopa - Project Context

## Project Mission

Snoopa is a proactive AI agent that hunts for verified facts (sports, tech, finance) and "snitches" them to users via a Greyhound mascot interface.
For now, what we're trying to achieve is getting the UI ready for the different features we're going to have for the mvp.
We'll take it little by little, feature by feature, frontend first before backend, please take note.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React Native (Expo Router v3+)
- **Backend:** Convex (Real-time DB & Cron Jobs)
- **Styling:** NativeWind (Tailwind CSS)
- **Fonts:** Space Grotesk (Headers), Geist (Body)
- **Design:** Tactical Luxury (Charcoal #141414, Bone #EBEBDF)

## Rules for Agents

- Always use the color palette defined in `constants/Colors.ts`.
- All our UI designs must be modern, clean, minimal but elegant at the same time.
- As for the font, please just use the font's with prefix FONT, don't use the GEIST font for now
- When writing Convex functions, always include type definitions and make use of snake_case for variables.
- Every code we write must be simple, dont complicate things that don't need to be complicated.
- Every feature must be "speed-optimized" (The Greyhound Spirit).
